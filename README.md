Here are the descriptions of each provided example.

###  Manual Step-By-Step Instruction Experience
The manual step-by-step instruction experience provides an experience with an assembly of an X-Wing Squadron. It shows a combinations of Javascript, binding and CSS features.

The button interactability and step labels are set through the application parameters in the [data pane](http://support.ptc.com/help/vuforia/studio/en/index.html#page/Studio_Help_Center/AppAndDevicePropPanel.html). The steps are written in an array that define the titles and descriptions. 

### Manual Step-By-Step Instruction Experience (With Ionicons icon font)
Integer vehicula est lacus, sed rutrum ante dictum blandit. Sed id lectus. 
https://ionicons.com/v2/

- Same as the manual step-by-step instruction experience but with Ionicons.
- Shows off Javascript, binding and (advanced) CSS.

### Dynamic Step-By-Step Instruction Experience
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris ullamcorper. 

- A more dynamic and scalable instruction experience. Might be based on an array, or notes from Creo Illustrate.

### Wayfinding Example
Sed rutrum ante dictum blandit. Sed id lectus. Integer vehicula est lacus.

- How to a guide users through my AR experience to pre-defined areas?

### Dynamic Highlighted Areas
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Cras eros lectus, feugiat sed. 

- How to I visualize areas based on locations I have stored, to check them in AR?
- How to highlight an area based on a JSON with data points.
